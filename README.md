# FEWD-tues-jan2017Project
A website for electrical and motor-control calculations.

This project is the first interactive website I have ever created.  It is the culminating project for my first Code Louisville class, which is focused on front end web development.  My brother has been a master electrician for over 10 years and teaches classes on electric and motor controls for the Northern Kentucky Homebuilders Association, the only accredited electrican association in northern Kentucky.  He has always commented that it would be nice to have a website that both calculates some of the basic equations for his classes, but also allows the students to test themselves at home.  This project is the beginning of my attempt to create this resource for him and any other electrical or engineering students that might find it useful.

The fonts and colors are meant to be a throw back to the older "Green Screen" Apple computers that so many students in the 80's and 90's encountered for the first time.  The pages are built with a "mobile first" approach and are responsive to multiple screen sizes and the navigation flexes well.  I included jQuery in the test page to reveal answers, and more questions can be created in the future.

The end goal is to complete the code for the calculator, include other pages for testing and calculations, and eventually create a free app for iOS and Android so that people can use the calculators and test on the go.

This project is currently unfinished.  The calculator code is not yet written and more pages beyond Resistance and Test 1 need to be created.Pages 3-5 are not yet existent and the links are dead.
