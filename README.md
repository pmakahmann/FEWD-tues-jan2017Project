# FEWD-tues-jan2017Project
A website for electrical and motor-control calculations.

This project is the first interactive website I have ever created.  It is the culminating project for my first Code Louisville class, which is
focused on front end web development.  My brother has been a master electrician for over 10 years and teaches classes on electric and motor controls
for the Northern Kentucky Homebuilders Association, the only accredited electrican association in northern Kentucky.  He has always commented
that it would be nice to have a website that both calculates some of the basic equations for his classes, but also allows the students to 
test themselves at home.  This project is the beginning of my attempt to create this resource for him and any other electrical or engineering students
that might find it useful.

The end goal is to complete the code for the calculator, include other pages for testing and calculations, and eventually create a free app 
for iOS and Android so that people can use the calculators and test on the go.

This project is currently unfinished.  The calculator code is not yet written and more pages beyond Resistance and Test 1 need to be created.
Pages 3-5 are not yet existent and the links are dead.
