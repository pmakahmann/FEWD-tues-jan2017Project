**Attention Code Louisville Reviewer**
While this project does satisfy all requirements, it was completed during week 2.  My full project is now in the RMC repository.  If you have navigated here first, please go and check out that repository in addition.

# FEWD-tues-jan2017Project
A website for electrical calculations.

Purpose and Origin:

This project is the first interactive website I have ever created.  It is the culminating project for my first Code Louisville class, which is focused on front end web development.  My brother has been a master electrician for over 10 years and teaches classes on electric and motor controls for the Northern Kentucky Homebuilders Association, the only accredited electrican association in northern Kentucky.  He has always commented that it would be nice to have a website that both calculates some of the basic equations for his classes, but also allows the students to test themselves at home.  This project is the beginning of my attempt to create this resource for him and any other electrical or engineering students that might find it useful.

Styling and Responsiveness:

The fonts and colors are meant to be a throw back to the older "Green Screen" Apple computers that so many students in the 80's and 90's encountered for the first time.  The pages are built with a "mobile first" approach and are responsive to multiple screen sizes and the navigation flexes well.  I included jQuery in the test pages to reveal answers, and more questions can be created in the future.

End Goal:

The end goal is to complete the code for the calculator, include other pages for testing and calculations, and eventually create a free app for iOS and Android so that people can use the calculators and test on the go.

State of the Project:

A wise man once said, "A project is never finished, it is only released."  While all pages and content are functional, there are still some apects of the JavaScript calculator that need to be polished.  More jQuery interaction could needs to be added.  Notes with my ideas for improvement are included in all of the HTML and script files.
